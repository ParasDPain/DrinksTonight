DrinksTonight
=============

'Drinks Tonight' is a smartphone app which let's users keep track of their alcohol intake. The user presses the button on the screen before each drink and later can view his intake thorugh the night or over a period of time (month, year) to keep tabs over drinking. The app will also enable the user to have an estimate of blood-alcohol level for drink and drive situations! Drinking can be dangerous and with this app I want to reduce the damage caused by careless drinking habits. Any help is appreciated!

I, the owner am a C programmer and java/xml is a new, messier world to me. To be frankly honest, I have made this (pre-alpha) from google dev support and so it is really basic and most probably full of bad code practices.
Any help will be greatly appreciated. I want to help people with bad drinking habits and I hope this app will make a difference :)
